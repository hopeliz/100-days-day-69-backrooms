# 100 Days of Shaders and Textures - Day 69: The Backrooms
[Day 69](https://hopemoore.com/100days/2020/07/18/day-69/) of [100 Days of Shaders and Textures](https://hopemoore.com/100days) involved recreating the famous Backrooms photo.

This is not a working project, but has textures that can be used. The lighting could be improved to make the image even better than seen in the project.
